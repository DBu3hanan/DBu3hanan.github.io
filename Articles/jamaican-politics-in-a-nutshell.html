                    Jamaican Politics in a Nutshell

            </h1><span style="font-family: times;">August 23, 2025 : 9:34PM<br />Diamond A. Buchanan | DasBuchanan@outlook.com</span><div><span style="font-family: times; font-size: x-small;"><br /></span></div><div><span class="cf0">The everlasting bickering and fighting of the Jamaica </span><span class="cf0">Labour</span><span class="cf0"> Party and the People's National Party reminds me of a very common scenario of an abusive and dysfunctional household where two parents constantly fight in front of their children. It is common knowledge that the only ones that are truly affected and left with the pieces to pick up are the children (the citizens of the country).</span></div><div><p class="pf0"></p><p class="pf0"><span class="cf0">There is more focus on spiting each other rather than working together to achieve a greater good in the country. The parties refuse to put aside party </span><span class="cf0">colours</span><span class="cf0"> and are thus constantly at odds at the unfortunate expense of the regular Jamaican.</span></p><p class="pf0"></p><p class="pf0"><span class="cf0">I have seen numerous examples of this in the nine years of the JLP being in power from the PNP. The two most glaring examples are Mark Golding and the PNP wholeheartedly opposing an initiative by the government to disallow persons who are brought in on murder charges from acquiring bail. </span></p><p class="pf0"></p><p class="pf0"><span class="cf0">There is absolutely no logical reason to oppose this other than to spite the government and slow down its push for crime control. Ultimately is a smaller ploy in a greater scheme by the PNP for the crime rate to spiral so far out of control in the country so that they can use it as a attack point against the JLP with no regards to the lives that will be lost and the subsequent harm this will cause to family units in the country. </span></p><p class="pf0"></p><p class="pf0"><span class="cf0">Unfortunately in October 2022 there was a incident of a man named </span><span class="cf0">Rushawn</span><span class="cf0"> Patterson  who murdered a young lady named Aneka T</span><span class="cf0">ownsend</span><span class="cf0">/</span><span class="cf0">Slickianna.&nbsp;</span><span class="cf0">Patterson had a history of repeated brushes with law enforcement dating back to 2010 After being apprehended by the police force he was unfortunately then allowed to be out on bail. Had the PNP worked with the government when it was proposed in June of the same year, </span><span class="cf0">Rushawn</span><span class="cf0"> Patterson would not have been granted bail after the murder of Slickianna.</span></p><p class="pf0"></p><p class="pf0"></p><p class="pf0"></p><p class="pf0"></p><p></p><p class="pf0"><span class="cf0">The second example of this is Mark Golding stalling the government effort to make Jamaica a republic. If you follow the Jamaican news you would know that Mr. Golding is a dual citizens who subsequently initially lied about this to the Jamaican people and only admitted it after coming under severe pressure and scrutiny. If Jamaica were to become a republic he would not be able to sit in parliament and that is why he is stalling the initiative</span></p></div><div><p class="pf0"><span class="cf0"><span style="font-family: times;">&nbsp;</span></span></p></div><div><br /></div>
