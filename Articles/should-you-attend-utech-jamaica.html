        <h1>Should you attend the University of Technology Jamaica?</h1><br />
        <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The University of Technology, Jamaica is one of the prominent universities in Jamaica, with the other being the University of the West Indies, Mona. Originally named the College of Arts, Science, and Technology. It was established in 1958 as the Jamaica Institute of Technology, then became CAST in 1959, and was later granted university status in 1995, officially changing its name to the University of Technology, Jamaica. This institution is the only university of technology in the entire Caribbean region. During its history the university has been responsible for the molding of several of Jamaica’s most prominent leaders in society and Jamaica’s most well known and celebrated athletes namely: Shelly Ann Fraser Pryce, Elaine Thompson Herah, Usain Bolt and Shericka Jackson.&nbsp;<br /><br /></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhsq1xB1dqiGs91rY13oCbKAYYDz7xksXWJJt6pbfQhLuGxq-a8Z0kyU7JbvI67EdQkpGIMYySoWIc37QHd9Jh8U8DWFyjJGh_0CBVWkNQiImu5RS-_5VQ8nnP1cdKBc8tcSTbO4QPgMUqHTdJEVEcKXUIx5i93tFF5G_wRvAzRKwgHO7S9mjBIG6qH-eKu/s1024/main-entrance-1024x683.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"></a></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><img border="0" data-original-height="683" data-original-width="1024" height="317" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhsq1xB1dqiGs91rY13oCbKAYYDz7xksXWJJt6pbfQhLuGxq-a8Z0kyU7JbvI67EdQkpGIMYySoWIc37QHd9Jh8U8DWFyjJGh_0CBVWkNQiImu5RS-_5VQ8nnP1cdKBc8tcSTbO4QPgMUqHTdJEVEcKXUIx5i93tFF5G_wRvAzRKwgHO7S9mjBIG6qH-eKu/w476-h317/main-entrance-1024x683.jpg" width="476" /></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;">However, the institution is not without its glaring faults such as its severe administrative and academic failures. The accumulation of these issues over the years has made the institution somewhat of a laughing stock amongst some Jamaicans, despite its rich and successful history. It is often referred to as a “patty shop” by Jamaicans. Here, I will name and expound upon some of those faults that have been plaguing Jamaica’s premier federal university for years.<br />&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><b><span style="font-size: medium;">Painful Module Selection Process</span></b></p><p data-end="576" data-start="308"><span style="font-size: medium;">The module selection process at the University of Technology, Jamaica is one of the most distressing experiences a student will encounter during their academic journey. Rather than being a simple administrative task, it is a recurring source of frustration and stress.</span></p><p data-end="1158" data-start="578"><span style="font-size: medium;">When module selection opens each semester, students brace themselves for a cumbersome ordeal. The university’s website frequently crashes or loads at an agonizingly slow pace, sometimes failing to even reach the splash page. After finally navigating to the student section and accessing the eVision portal, users are often met with a new set of problems. Logins may be rejected even when credentials are correct, or the portal may stall indefinitely before crashing. In some cases, the site accepts login details only to time out or revert to the login screen without explanation.</span></p><p data-end="1646" data-start="1160"><span style="font-size: medium;">If students manage to access the module selection area, the problems persist. Searching for and adding modules to the basket is an exercise in patience. The system may take several minutes to process a single selection, and it often crashes mid-action, forcing the user to start over. This unreliable process must be repeated for each module, which can easily mean five or more separate attempts. Between selections, the site may time out, refuse to load, or simply become unresponsive.</span></p><p data-end="1990" data-start="1648"><span style="font-size: medium;">Once modules are finally added, students must attempt to generate their timetable. This, too, is plagued with issues. The timetable builder may display errors indicating nonexistent clashes, fail to recognize selected modules, or load a blank screen altogether. In many cases, the process ends with the student being logged out involuntarily.</span></p><p>



        </p><p data-end="2216" data-start="1992"><span style="font-size: medium;">It is not uncommon for students to encounter all of these issues during a single selection period. The result is a process that is inefficient, stressful, and wholly unacceptable for a tertiary institution in the modern age. Ultimately, a process that should take you around thirty minutes, ends up taking a whole day. In some instances it has take students two whole days to select their modules.</span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></b></p><h3 data-end="372" data-start="343"><strong data-end="372" data-start="347"><span style="font-size: medium;">Poor Customer Service</span></strong></h3><p data-end="792" data-start="374"><span style="font-size: medium;">One of the most frustrating aspects of interacting with the Utech is its deeply flawed customer service. Attempts to contact the institution by phone are often fruitless. In many cases, calls go unanswered, and when they are, students rarely receive clear or helpful responses. As a result, students are routinely forced to visit the campus in person to resolve even the simplest of issues.</span></p><p data-end="1245" data-start="794"><span style="font-size: medium;">However, visiting the campus brings its own set of frustrations. There exists a pervasive culture of avoidance and deflection among administrative staff. Students seeking help are frequently shuffled between departments, each claiming that the issue falls outside their purview. What begins as a simple query quickly turns into a bureaucratic maze, with students visiting multiple offices only to be told, repeatedly, that they are in the wrong place.</span></p><p data-end="1637" data-start="1247"><span style="font-size: medium;">This practice of passing responsibility from one department to another not only wastes time but fosters a sense of neglect and disrespect. Staff are often unwilling to assist beyond the narrow scope of their job descriptions, and few take initiative to provide real solutions. Students, in particular, are not treated as valued stakeholders in the institution, but rather as inconveniences.</span></p><p>



        </p><p data-end="1891" data-start="1639"><span style="font-size: medium;">This breakdown in service and accountability creates an experience that is not only inefficient but also emotionally exhausting. For an institution of higher learning, especially one of national standing, such treatment of its students is unacceptable.</span></p><h3 data-end="372" data-start="343"><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></h3><h3 data-end="290" data-start="258"><strong data-end="290" data-start="262"><span style="font-size: medium;">Lack of Staff Confidence</span></strong></h3><p data-end="658" data-start="292"><span style="font-size: medium;">A concerning issue at the UTech is the deeply troubling apparent lack of confidence among its own staff in the institution’s vision and direction. This is reflected not only in how duties are carried out often with indifference or a lack of urgency but also in the general disregard for persistent internal problems, particularly those affecting the very students that the the university should be catering to.</span></p><p data-end="1059" data-start="660"><span style="font-size: medium;">Despite the university offering financial assistance to staff members seeking higher education, many choose not to pursue their studies at UTech. Instead, they frequently opt for its closest rival, the University of the West Indies, Mona. This behavior sends a clear and troubling message: that even those within the university do not see it as a place of academic advancement or professional trust.</span></p><p data-end="1388" data-start="1061"><span style="font-size: medium;">This lack of confidence is also evident in the everyday conversations and culture among staff. When issues, arise as they often do, they are met with cynical remarks or dismissive attitudes. Phrases such as “A just UTech” are frequently uttered, not as criticism meant to spur improvement, but as resignation to dysfunction.</span></p><p>



        </p><p data-end="1626" data-start="1390"><span style="font-size: medium;">For an institution tasked with shaping the nation’s future professionals, this internal disillusionment is deeply problematic. A university cannot hope to inspire belief in its mission if its own employees have already lost faith in it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></b></p><h3 data-end="322" data-start="275"><strong data-end="322" data-start="279"><span style="font-size: medium;">Lack of Air Conditioning in the Library</span></strong></h3><p data-end="651" data-start="324"><span style="font-size: medium;">Very few government-funded schools at any level in Jamaica have the benefit of an on-campus library. When such a facility is available, it is typically equipped with air conditioning, as is expected for a quiet and comfortable study environment. UTech, unfortunately does not meet this standard.</span></p><p data-end="1031" data-start="653"><span style="font-size: medium;">The Calvin McKain Library has been without air conditioning for over three years. Instead, the building relies on oscillating fans, which are ineffective during warm weather and provide little relief for students using the space. This creates a physically uncomfortable environment that hinders extended study sessions and reduces the overall quality of the academic experience.</span></p><p data-end="1276" data-start="1033"><span style="font-size: medium;">What makes this situation particularly troubling is that certain areas within the library, specifically those occupied by library staff, do have functioning air conditioning. This suggests a pattern of neglect when it comes to student comfort.</span></p><p data-end="1671" data-start="1278"><span style="font-size: medium;">This pattern is further reinforced by conditions elsewhere on campus. The main administrative building, which houses the president’s office along with departments such as student finance, accounting, and records, is fully air-conditioned. Yet the student lobby within the same building, a central waiting and service area for students, has been without air conditioning for a prolonged period.</span></p><p>




        </p><p data-end="1835" data-start="1673"><span style="font-size: medium;">This stark contrast reflects a troubling reality. The university appears to prioritize staff comfort while consistently overlooking the needs of the student body.</span></p><p data-end="1835" data-start="1673"><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></p><h3 data-end="357" data-start="298"><strong data-end="357" data-start="302"><span style="font-size: medium;">You Have to Pay for an Opportunity at an Internship</span></strong></h3><p data-end="767" data-start="359"><span style="font-size: medium;">Unlike other universities that assist students in securing internships free of charge, such as the Caribbean Maritime University, UTech takes a different approach. Within the School of Computing and Information Technology, a part of the Faculty of Engineering and Computing, internship placements have been converted into a formal academic module, typically worth four credits.</span></p><p data-end="1195" data-start="769"><span style="font-size: medium;">This four-credit internship module comes at a significant cost. Students are required to pay no less than $50,000 JMD to register for it. What makes the situation worse is that students are strongly encouraged to secure their own internship placements before even selecting the module. The university does not provide a structured system to source internships or to advocate on behalf of its students with potential employers.</span></p><p data-end="1835" data-start="1673">


        </p><p data-end="1564" data-start="1197"><span style="font-size: medium;">As a result, students must bear the cost of the module, conduct their own search for internship opportunities from a limited list, and then hope that the company selected is willing to accept them. In some cases, even when a placement is arranged through the university’s list, the host company may offer no form of monetary compensation, providing only a daily lunch.</span></p><p data-end="1564" data-start="1197"><span style="font-size: medium;">This practice raises serious concerns. Internships are intended to be opportunities for students to gain real-world experience and build professional skills, not additional financial burdens. In my opinion,<span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; white-space-collapse: preserve;">&nbsp;I find it be an extremely shameful display of greed and lack of student care to lock internships behind a paywall. </span></span></p><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: medium; white-space-collapse: preserve;"><br /></span></div><h3 data-end="308" data-start="279"><strong data-end="308" data-start="283"><span style="font-size: medium;">Lack of State Funding</span></strong></h3><p data-end="708" data-start="310"><span style="font-size: medium;">The challenges faced by the University of Technology, Jamaica, are not entirely the result of internal mismanagement. A significant share of the institution’s difficulties stems from inadequate state funding. In 2024, the Government of Jamaica reduced the university’s annual subsidy by one billion dollars, leaving UTech with approximately $2.3 billion in subvention for the 2024–2025 fiscal year.</span></p><p data-end="1204" data-start="710"><span style="font-size: medium;">This budget cut had direct consequences for students. In response, the university increased tuition fees by three percent, further straining families who are already grappling with the high cost of tertiary education. It is important to understand that UTech is Jamaica’s federal university. It belongs to the Jamaican people, with a mandate to serve national development. Yet, despite this status, it receives significantly less support from the government when compared to other institutions.</span></p><p>


        </p><p data-end="1507" data-start="1206"><span style="font-size: medium;">The most troubling comparison is with the University of the West Indies, Mona, which receives nearly three times more in government subvention than UTech. This disparity raises serious questions about funding priorities and whether the nation’s own technological university is being treated equitably.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-end="1507" data-start="1206"><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></b></p><p data-end="1507" data-start="1206"><b><span style="font-size: medium;">Conclusion</span></b></p><p data-end="1507" data-start="1206"><span style="font-size: medium;">In spite of its many shortcomings, the University of Technology, Jamaica, does offer certain advantages to its students. The institution provides access to several internal grants, including the Student Union Grant and the Student Services Grant, which can help to ease the financial burden for eligible applicants. Additionally, the university operates an “Earn and Study” program that allows students to gain practical work experience by serving in select departments across campus.</span></p><p data-end="1507" data-start="1206"><span style="font-size: medium;">Academically, the cost of education at UTech remains more affordable or cheaper than that of its rival, the University of the West Indies, Mona. However, this lower cost often reflects in the quality of services and available. Simply put, students will absolutely get what they pay for. The institution must therefore take seriously the calls for reform, improvement, and equitable investment, if it is to fulfill and finally live up to its role as Jamaica’s national university.</span></p>
