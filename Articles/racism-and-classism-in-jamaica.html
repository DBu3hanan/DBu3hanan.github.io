The Motto</span></i></b></p><p><span style="font-family: times;">&nbsp;"Out of Many One People", Jamaica's motto. Its a line that supposed to make a Jamaican proud of their&nbsp; country and it's welcoming nature. The motto conveys a sense of belonging to all that enter Jamaica either permanently or temporary. It can serve as a guideline for all and gives nations a reminder of how they are to treat everyone within the country, however in recent years the motto has taken on a different meaning.&nbsp; A dark one. it can be said that the many was created by the higher ups or persons of wealthier backgrounds to gaslight those who are not so wealthy into accepting classism and racism in the country. When an "uptown" persons show little to no regard for those who are perceived as beneath them the motto is used to remind the poorer class that Jamaica's motto means everyone must be accepted. It really begs the question, was the true meaning of the motto really the latter. A shield for which the wealthy can hide behind when they show their true racist, classist colours.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: times;"><br /></span></p><p><b><i><span style="font-family: times;">2. The People</span></i></b></p><p><span style="font-family: times;">It seems to be a recurring pattern that whenever the wealthy show their disregard for the poorer class, there are always some within the poorer class who rush to their defense. Their typical response is that if they had the same wealth, they would behave similarly. Furthermore, many in the poorer class are upset with the wealthy not just because of their behavior, but because they envy their financial status. They harbor resentment because the wealthy possess what they do not. Lastly, and more insidiously, there is a belief that the poorer class should simply ignore the wealthy because nothing can be done to stop or change their behavior. Why are excuses always made by a segment of the poorer class? It is said that this certain percentage absolves the wealthy in hopes of being accepted by them, but even someone with little understanding of the world knows that this will never happen.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: times;"><br /></span></p><p><b><i><span style="font-family: times;">3. The conclusion</span></i></b></p><p><span style="font-family: times;">In conclusion, the motto "Out of Many, One People" is intended to unify and inspire, yet its interpretation has been twisted by societal disparities. The recurring defense of the wealthy by a segment of the poorer class underscores deep-seated issues of envy, resignation, and misplaced hope. These dynamics reveal the complexities of class relations and the harsh reality that aspirations for acceptance by the affluent are often futile. This ongoing cycle calls for a deeper reflection on the true values of unity and equality, challenging us to uphold the motto's original spirit and strive for a more just and inclusive society.</span></p>
