        <font color="white">
           <small>Devloping my Computer literacy has always been the main goal for me over the years. <br><br>  I realized I had
            a passion for Technology and IT related situations in high school. <br><br>  Since then I've been constantly trying to find news areas in which
            I could gather meaningful information and techniques about the field. <br><br>   I wanted it to materialize in such a 
            way that i could implement in as my daily life both as a career and as a hobby and passion. <br><br>   I'm always on the lookout for new technologies and am willing
            to learn how they work and how they can make my daily life and those of others a little bit easier. <br><br>  I hope that one day I would I have formulated technology that is used
            by people worldwide.<br><br>  </small>

<center><font color="Gold"><h4>CREATIVITY</h4></center></font>
    <p>
        <font color="white">
           <small> At an early age, I realized I was very creative and gifted with crafting abstract images using shapes 
            <br><br> This therfore developed into my interest in Technical Drawing.
            <br><br>In high school it was my absolute favourite subject as it allowed me to express myself the way I know how 
            <br><br> Not with words, but with art 
            <br><br> I quickly found a liking for architecture, architecturual drawings and interior design and have practiced and nurtured my skill since then

        <p>
            <font color="white">
               <small> I have always been interested in the field of pyschology 
                <br><br> I find that I always want to see things from other peoples perspective
                <br><br>I delight in experiencing people of different backgrounds and cultures and those who have an opinion different than that of mine 
                <br><br> I find myself being the friend who is always giving advise 
                <br><br> I find no difficulty in putting my emotions aside and analyzing things on a broader scale.

                <font color="white">
                       <small> After reading the chapters, I can safely say that Micheal and I are pretty similar
                        <br><br> I was never one to set goals and stick by them nor did I truly comprehend that friends impact you so much
                        <br><br> Like michael I too am frustrated with the fact that you can achieve goals overnight and proceed with life as such
                        <br><br> I too feel as if I have wasted numerous years of my life doing the wrong things and pursuing the outcomes
                        <br><br> Finding where to start the recovery of your life is often the hardest part of trying to right your wrongs
                        <br><br> The line that resonates with me the most is the one that says 
                        <br><br> "The pain of discipline or the pain of regret. The difference is discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons"
                        <br><br> Just like Michael, Charlie has taught me a lot
                        <br><br> Appying what I read to my life would be to start setting meaningful goals, becoming mindful of the company I keep and aspiring to become a life long learner.
