document.getElementById("Bio-Text-ProfessionalLife").innerHTML = " I initially wanted to become an architect and that career trajectory was what solely drove me during my high school years. I pursued Technical Drawing in CSEC(Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate) and Building and Mechanical and Engineering Drawing (BMED) in CAPE (Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination) in hopes of getting accepted into university to start my degree in architecture. <br> <br> However I did not pursue that career professional and instead chose my second option which is information technology, whcih I loved just as much as the first.I still practice technical drawing but as a hobby and I do plan to get certified in the near future.I began my college education in 2021 and even though I knew i wanted a career in technology I was not sure in which specific area.That revelation didn't come until my second year, which was when I discovered web programming through doing my degree modules of course. It stuck with me since then and I have build numerous sites and projects. Two of the major ones being The Information Technology Experience and XfinityTools. There are countless others of course but these two are the most professionally recognized ones. They are both indexed and monetized by google"
