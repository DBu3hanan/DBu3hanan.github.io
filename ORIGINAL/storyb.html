<center><font color="Gold"><h4>Theme of the Website:  </h4></center></font>


The Theme of the website is a black background colour with <font color="gold">Gold </font>and White highlights and text. <br><br>
The text or content on the page were engineered in such a way to imitate movie credits when the website is scrolled.  <br><br>
The movie credit aspect to the page was implemented because of my adoration for movies  <br><br> 
The pages are also engineering in such a way that the user cannot see the content of the website without scrolling down
<br><br> The only thing that is seen is the introductory photo on the page. 
<br><br>When completely scrolled to the buttom of the page the user should also be unable to see the introductory photo 
<br><br>I believe that with the unique way the website is engineered, it gives the website a nice look and feel
<br><br>It also gives the user a different experience as opposed to other websites 
<br><br> I did not want my website to follow the normal conventions of what a website should look and feel like
<br><br> Therefore I implemented it in a different way, to my liking of course.
